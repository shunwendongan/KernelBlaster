# Core 10 manual optimization vs same-GPU PyTorch

## Result

On one RTX 3080 (sm_86), all ten candidates passed the official FP16 correctness Driver. The raw candidate medians produced a 6.351x geometric mean over the upstream implementations, but four tasks exceeded the 5% cross-session stability limit. Applying the strict gate—correct, stable, no slower session, and at least 1.01x—validated tasks 004, 007, 036, and 040. Counting every other task as 1.0 gives a 4.356x all-ten portfolio score.

Against the fastest same-GPU PyTorch method measured per task, the candidate medians have a diagnostic 1.447x geometric mean and win 7/10 tasks. This includes unstable microbenchmarks and is not a release-grade claim. After falling back to upstream for every unverified candidate, the geometric mean versus PyTorch is 0.992x: effectively parity, with PyTorch about 0.8% faster overall.

The strongest specialized results are RMSNorm and the fixed-shape large LayerNorm. Matrix-vector and small-K matmul are already close to PyTorch; the latter explicitly uses cuBLAS, so it demonstrates correct library use rather than a custom GEMM beating cuBLAS. MinGPT GELU matches PyTorch only when compared with the equivalent fused GELU primitive; comparing against the unfused Driver formula would misleadingly show an 8.8x win.

This is best described as a strong fixed-shape CUDA optimization prototype, not yet a production operator library. The candidates do not yet cover arbitrary shapes, dtypes, layouts, streams, graph capture, backward passes, or strict randomized numerical testing. Static workspaces in 040/095 also need production lifecycle and concurrency work.
