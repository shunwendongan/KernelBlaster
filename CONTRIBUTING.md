Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

## Signing Your Work

To certify your compliance with the DCO, you must add a `Signed-off-by` line to each commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

You can do this automatically by using the `-s` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Description of your change"
```

**Note:** The name and email in the `Signed-off-by` line must match the name and email in your git configuration (`git config user.name` and `git config user.email`).

## How to Contribute

2. **Create a branch** for your feature or fix:

   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and commit with the DCO sign-off:
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "Add my feature"
   ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure all commits are signed off (DCO).
- Provide a clear description of what your change does and why.
- Keep pull requests focused — one feature or fix per PR.
- Add or update tests where applicable.
- Make sure existing tests pass.

## README Language Policy

- Keep the root `README.md` in English and `README.zh-CN.md` in Simplified Chinese.
- Any directory-level `README.md` added in this fork should have a matching `README.zh-CN.md` in the same directory.
- When README content changes, update both language versions in the same pull request. Commands, paths, validation status, attribution, and performance figures must remain consistent.

## Code Style

- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) conventions.
