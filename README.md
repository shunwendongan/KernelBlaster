# KernelBlaster

## Project Intro

<p><strong><span style="color:#0f766e;">Introducing KernelBlaster, a Memory-Augmented In-context Reinforcement Learning (MAIC-RL) framework</span></strong></p>

Optimizing CUDA code across multiple GPU generations is difficult because the best implementation depends on a large and hardware-specific search space. A kernel that looks reasonable on one GPU can leave performance on the table on another, and simple rewrites are rarely enough to reach the best result.

Traditional compiler pipelines are limited by fixed heuristics, while fully finetuning large language models for every optimization setting is expensive. Many agentic CUDA workflows also have a simpler problem: they do not remember enough from previous exploration. That leads to repeated mistakes, biased sampling, and weaker optimization choices.

KernelBlaster is built to make that search smarter. Instead of treating each kernel as an isolated prompt, it combines profiling feedback, a persistent CUDA optimization knowledge base, and reinforcement-learning-style exploration. The agent does not just generate code; it profiles, reflects, retrieves prior optimization knowledge, explores new candidates, and updates its strategy over time.

The result is a reusable open-source framework for CUDA optimization with verification, profiling, replay, and reproducible evaluation built in.

Compared to the PyTorch baseline, KernelBlaster achieves geometric mean speedups of <strong><span style="color:#ef4444;">1.43x</span></strong> on KernelBench Level 1, <strong><span style="color:#2563eb;">2.50x</span></strong> on Level 2, and <strong><span style="color:#16a34a;">1.50x</span></strong> on Level 3.

## Why KernelBlaster

| Others | KernelBlaster |
| --- | --- |
| CUDA optimization is hardware-agnostic and requires searching a large design space. | KernelBlaster narrows that search with hardware-aware profiling-guided state extraction and targeted optimization selection. |
| Fixed compiler heuristics cannot easily adapt to every kernel or GPU generation. | KernelBlaster adapts optimization decisions to each kernel and GPU generation through retrieval and iterative search. |
| Finetuning LLMs for optimization is costly and slow to iterate on. | KernelBlaster improves optimization through in-context memory and RL-style exploration without depending on expensive task-specific finetuning. |
| Naive agent loops forget what they learned from earlier kernels and earlier rollouts. | KernelBlaster keeps memory in the loop through a persistent optimization database and replay-driven exploration. |

## How It Works

KernelBlaster starts from the initial KernelBench-CUDA input artifacts. Each problem provides a starter CUDA implementation in `init.cu` and a matching C++ harness in `driver.cpp`. The CUDA file is the code to optimize; the driver builds, runs, and validates the kernel against the reference behavior.

From there, the pipeline runs an agentic optimization loop:

1. Load the input problem from `data/kernelbench-cuda/<level>/<problem>/`.
2. Use `init.cu` as the starting CUDA kernel and `driver.cpp` as the validation harness.
3. Compile and profile candidate kernels, with Nsight Compute metrics and elapsed cycles as the main performance signal.
4. Retrieve relevant optimization ideas from the persistent CUDA knowledge base.
5. Generate a new candidate using profile-guided, textual-gradient-style prompts.
6. Evaluate the candidate, reward successful trajectories, and store them in the replay buffer.
7. Update future decisions using what worked, what failed, and the feedback from the profiler.
8. Save the best optimized kernel as `final_rl_cuda_perf.cu`.

In code, the default single-run path is:

- `scripts/run_single_kernelblaster.sh` starts the runtime environment and launches the RL run.
- `scripts/run_RL.py` prepares the dataset, servers, and workflow inputs.
- `src/kernelblaster/workflow/workflow.py` invokes the graph-based workflow.
- `src/kernelblaster/graph/nodes/optimization_rl_ncu.py` loads `init.cu` and `driver.cpp`, then launches the RL optimization agent.
- `src/kernelblaster/agents/opt_ncu_rl.py` runs the rollout, profiling, replay-buffer, and strategy-update loop.

This figure shows the end-to-end optimization loop. KernelBlaster starts from the input kernel and the target GPU hardware, extracts a performance state, matches that state against the knowledge base, selects a promising optimization, lowers it into code, tests correctness, profiles the result, and repeats until the termination check decides that the search has converged. The final stage uses LLM soft verification before writing the optimized output kernel.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the container

```bash
docker build . -t kernelblaster -f docker/Dockerfile
```

### 2. Launch the container

```bash
docker run --rm -it --name=kernelblaster \
    --privileged --gpus all --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --device /dev/fuse \
    --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    --ipc=host --net=host \
    -e USER_NAME=$(whoami) \
    -e USER_ID=$(id -u) \
    -e GROUP_ID=$(id -g) \
    -v $(pwd):/kernelblaster \
    kernelblaster \
    dev
```

### 3. Set your API key and run the default example

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
export MODEL=${MODEL:-gpt-5-mini-2025-08-07}
export GPU_TYPE=${GPU_TYPE:-L40S}
export DATASET=${DATASET:-kernelbench-cuda}
export EXPERIMENT_NAME=${EXPERIMENT_NAME:-timing_analysis}
export RL_EXPERIMENT_NAME=${RL_EXPERIMENT_NAME:-kernelblaster}

bash scripts/run_single_kernelblaster.sh
```

By default, `scripts/run_single_kernelblaster.sh` launches a single KernelBench-CUDA RL optimization run with profiling enabled, starts the shared GPU server if needed, and writes outputs under `out/<dataset>/<precision>/<experiment>/`.

Note that this example runs a single sample from the Level 1 KernelBench-CUDA dataset. This can be extended by passing additional problems via the `--problem-numbers` flag and the `--subset` flag.

```bash
bash scripts/run_single_kernelblaster.sh --problem-numbers 1-10 --subset level2
```

### 4. What to expect

- Input kernels come from `data/kernelbench-cuda/`.
- The default script runs a Level 1 problem and performs RL-based CUDA optimization.
- Trajectory artifacts, prompts, logs, and best outputs will be tracked in the run's `out` directory.
- The best optimized kernel is written as `final_rl_cuda_perf.cu`.
- The trained optimization database will be tracked in the run's `out` directory, as `optimization_database.json`.

### 5. Reproduce PyTorch baseline

To compare/reproduce the speedup KernelBlaster made, run the PyTorch baseline runner `scripts/run_baselines.py` (testing on Torch Eager) and `scripts/run_baselines_compile.py` (testing on Torch Compile) on the benchmark problems.

Before running, clone KernelBench under `data/` 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/KernelBench.git data/KernelBench
```

It walks a root directory looking for `problem.py` files, imports each problem module dynamically, builds the `Model`, gets init args and inputs from `get_init_inputs()` / `get_inputs()`, moves them to CPU or CUDA, runs warmup + timed forward passes, and reports latency statistics. In NCU mode it instead launches Nsight Compute on each problem and reports either Elapsed Cycles or another raw metric.

```bash
# Torch Eager baseline
python scripts/run_baselines.py --root data/KernelBench/KernelBench/level1 --device cuda

# torch.compile baseline
python scripts/run_baselines_compile.py --root data/KernelBench/KernelBench/level1 --device cuda

# Nsight Compute (NCU) mode (reports Elapsed Cycles by default)
python scripts/run_baselines.py --root data/KernelBench/KernelBench/level1 --device cuda --ncu
```

### CUDA Knowledge Base data structure 

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/figures/json.png" alt="Example state entry in the knowledge base" width="520" />
</p>

The knowledge base stores optimization experience in a structured state-centered form. Each state captures a bottleneck pattern, the primary performance issue, the secondary characteristics that identify it, and the optimizations that have been effective for similar kernels. This is what lets KernelBlaster reuse prior search experience instead of starting every task from scratch.

### State groups and optimization choices

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/figures/ODEa_small.png" alt="Knowledge base state groups and optimization performance" width="520" />
</p>

This figure illustrates how the knowledge base is organized around state families such as memory-limited, compute-bound, and hybrid states. Within each state, KernelBlaster tracks how different optimization techniques performed before, which helps it bias future search toward strategies with better expected payoff while still leaving room to explore.

### Memory across tasks and rollouts

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/figures/KB.png" alt="Memory-augmented search across tasks and time" width="720" />
</p>

This figure explains the memory-augmented part of MAIC-RL. Past rollouts from earlier tasks are stored in the knowledge base as actual measured performance. When KernelBlaster faces a new state in a future rollout, it uses those past results to steer the search toward higher-value regions of the optimization space and away from paths that previously underperformed.

### Optimization diversity across states

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/figures/opt_pie.png" alt="Distribution of optimization applications grouped by state" width="920" />
</p>

This figure shows the breadth of the optimization space covered by the framework. Different state groups call for different techniques, including vectorized memory access, tensor core utilization, work-per-thread tuning, shared-memory tiling, kernel fusion, occupancy tuning, and several smaller specialized transformations. That diversity is important because no single optimization strategy dominates across all CUDA kernels.

Further, this Knowledge Base can be found in `KernelBlaster/data/kernelblaster/optimization_database.json` and serves as a guide for general performance engineering agents or can be used as labeled training data for model training.
